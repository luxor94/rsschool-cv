Since childhood, I wanted to do programming, but something didn't work out.
And I study and work in a different field.
But after a few years, my friend showed me these courses, he told me that many of our mutual friends have finished them and are working as developers, he said that this is one of the best courses.

And without hesitation he signed up. And he started to master basic html, css and js skills.
I go to courses 3 times, in this set I go with full determination to complete them. For about a year now, I have been studying new material almost every day, solving problems and writing code.
During this time, I rewrote the:
 *calculator, 
 *keyboard,
 *canvas. 
 Bringing them to perfection. As well as looking for and solving new problems.

Calculator code snippet:
```
const keyButtoms = rowsOrder.forEach(buttom => {
  if (buttom.match(/[0-9.]/)) {
    numberButtons = create('button', `number`, `${buttom}`, keyboard, ['data-number']);
  }
  else if (buttom.match(/=/)) equalsButton = create('button', `equals`, `${buttom}`, keyboard, ['data-equals'])
  else if (buttom.match(/CE/)) allClearButton = create('button', `all-clear`, `${buttom}`, keyboard, ['data-all-clear'])
  else if (buttom.match(/C/)) clearButton = create('button', `clear`, `${buttom}`, keyboard, ['data-clear'])
  else if (buttom.match(/[\*\-()âˆš^+%//]/)) deleteButton = create('button', `operation`, `${buttom}`, keyboard, ['data-operation'])
  else return
})
```

I study at the Belarusian State Technical University at the Faculty of Energy.
I study English together with studying at rs school.

*I also lead an active lifestyle and always try to learn something new.*
